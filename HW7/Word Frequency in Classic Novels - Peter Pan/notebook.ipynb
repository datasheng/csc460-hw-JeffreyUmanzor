One day when she was two years old she was playing\r\nin a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I\r\nsuppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand\r\nto her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for\r\never!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but\r\nhenceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.\r\nTwo is the beginning of the end.\r\n\n\r\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.\r\nShe was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her\r\nromantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the\r\npuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her\r\nsweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there\r\nit was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.\r\n\n\r\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when\r\nshe was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran\r\nto her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in\r\nfirst, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the\r\nkiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.\r\nWendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and\r\nthen going off in a passion, slamming the door.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but\r\nrespected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.\r\nOf course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said\r\nstocks we\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now we can extract the words from the text\n#create tokenizer\ntokenizer = tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer(r'\\b\\w+\\b')\n\n#tokenize the text\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n\n#print out first 10 words\nprint(tokens[:10])","execution_count":122,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['The', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'eBook', 'of', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'by', 'James', 'M']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#in order for proper counting, we create a list with all words in lowercase\nwords = [word.lower() for word in tokens]\n\n#print out first 10 words in words\nprint(words[:10])","execution_count":123,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['the', 'project', 'gutenberg', 'ebook', 'of', 'peter', 'pan', 'by', 'james', 'm']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# assign stopwords so that we can remove uninteresting words\n\nsw = stopwords.words('english')\n\n#print the first 10 stopwords\nprint(sw[:10])","execution_count":124,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['i', 'me', 'my', 'myself', 'we', 'our', 'ours', 'ourselves', 'you', \"you're\"]\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now we can remove the stopwords from the list of words\nwords_ns = [word for word in words if word not in sw]\n\n#print first 10 words without stopwords\nprint(words_ns[:10])","execution_count":125,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['project', 'gutenberg', 'ebook', 'peter', 'pan', 'james', 'barrie', 'body', 'margin', 'left']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now we can count the most frequent words in Peter Pan\n#create counter for list of words\ncount = Counter(words_ns)\n\n#create list of top 10 words with their counts\ntop_ten = count.most_common(10)\n\n#print out top 10 words\nprint(top_ten)","execution_count":126,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"[('peter', 409), ('wendy', 362), ('said', 358), ('would', 217), ('one', 212), ('hook', 174), ('could', 142), ('cried', 136), ('john', 133), ('time', 126)]\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now we can see out of the top 10 most frequent words used, how many were character names\n#create a list to store the character names\nprotagonists = ['peter', 'wendy','hook', 'john']\n\nprint(protagonists)\n","execution_count":127,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['peter', 'wendy', 'hook', 'john']\n","name":"stdout"}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
